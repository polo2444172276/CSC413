University of Toronto's CSC413: Deep Learning and Neural Network Course. 

Course webpage: https://csc413-uoft.github.io/2021/

I am taking this course in 2021 Winter with prof Jimmy Ba and Bo Wang. There are 4 programming assignments, 4 math assignments, and a final project(also has a midterm). It introduces a broad range of deep learning topics(CNN, RNN, GAN etc.) and moreover, some state-of-the-art models (BERT, Style2-GAN etc). As a fourth-year course, it is very time-consuming, yet very intersesting and makes me learn so much. I really recommend it.
